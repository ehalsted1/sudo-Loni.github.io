I am a first year PhD student at Oregon State University in the Robotics Program.

My research interests are in human-robot interaction, computer vision, robotic training methods, world models, and AI safety for non-general populations.

My purpose is to help others by leveraging my skills in connecting with communities, research, and problem-solving to address healthcare gaps through designing ethical AI and robotic systems, ultimately aiming to create accessible, ethical and compassionate healthcare solutions for caregivers and patients alike.
